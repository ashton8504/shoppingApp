# Shopping App

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

This is a mobile shopping app that was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. The purpose of building this app was to further my learning of web development and database integration.

Features:
- Users can add items to their shopping list.
- Items are stored in a Firebase Realtime Database.
- The shopping list is automatically updated in real-time for all users.
- The app is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly.

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Firebase Realtime Database

Installation:
To use this app, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You will need an internet connection to connect to the Firebase Realtime Database.

Usage:
To add an item to the shopping list, simply type the item name into the input field and click the "Add" button or press Enter on your keyboard. The item will be added to the shopping list, which is displayed on the screen.

The shopping list is automatically updated in real-time for all users who are accessing the app. This means that if one user adds an item to the list, all other users will see the updated list immediately without needing to refresh the page.

Future Improvements:
There are several ways that this app could be improved in the future, including:

- Adding user authentication to allow users to log in and access their own shopping lists.
- Adding the ability to mark items as purchased or remove them from the list.
- Adding the ability to categorize items by store or location.
- Improving the design and user interface to make it more visually appealing and intuitive to use.

This app was developed by Ashton Little as a personal project to further their learning of web development and database integration.
