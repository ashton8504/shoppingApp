# Shopping App

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

This is a mobile shopping app that was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. The purpose of building this app was to further my learning of web development and database integration.

I recently built a mobile shopping app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase to further my learning of web development. This project was a great opportunity for me to gain new skills and knowledge, and I'm excited to share what I learned with you.

One of the biggest things I learned from this project was how to use HTML and CSS to create the structure and design of a web app. I spent a lot of time tinkering with different layouts and styles until I found something that I was happy with. I also learned how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to my app, including handling user input and updating the DOM to reflect changes in data.

Using Firebase to create a Realtime Database for my app was another big learning experience for me. I had never worked with a database before, so I had to learn how to read and write data in real-time using JavaScript. This was a bit of a challenge at first, but once I got the hang of it, it was really cool to see how my app could update in real-time for all users.

One of the most satisfying things about this project was seeing my app come together and work the way I wanted it to. I spent a lot of time debugging and testing my code, but it was all worth it in the end. I also learned the importance of creating a responsive layout that works well on small screens, since my app was designed to be mobile-first.

Overall, building this shopping app was a great learning experience for me, and I'm excited to take what I learned and apply it to future projects. I now feel more confident in my ability to create web apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase, and I'm excited to see where my skills take me next.
